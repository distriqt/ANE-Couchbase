Couchbase Server is an open source, distributed, NoSQL document-oriented database. It exposes a fast key-value store with managed cache for submillisecond data operations, purpose-built indexers for fast queries and a query engine for executing SQL-like queries. For mobile and Internet of Things environments Couchbase Lite runs natively on-device and manages synchronization to Couchbase Server.


This ANE is an implementation of Couchbase Lite.



## Couchbase Server

You are probably going to be using a Couchbase server to sync your data. The Couchbase server can be 
used through the "Sync Gateway" as a destination for your Couchbase Lite database to use as a sync
destination.

Setup of the Couchbase Server and Sync Gateway is outside the scope of this documentation. 

A good place to start is with the getting started guides:
